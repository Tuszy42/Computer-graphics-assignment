Computer-graphics-assignment
============================

This is an assignment made for my Computer graphics class. The OSG map contains the Open Scene Graph project, the OGL map contains the OpenGL project
Both project are made in Microsoft visual studio.

I made a basic sphere and cylinder shape in OSG, exported it into two .obj files, then imported it into OGL.
Camera, lights, and limbs are controlled with keayboard.
